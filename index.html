  <b> Stage 0 Notes: Getting Started with HTML</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b> <em> Basics Of The Web</em></b>
  <br>
  - The web is a collection of HTML documents.
  <br>
  - HTML stands for hypertext markup language
  <br>
  -- Text is what it is displayed
  <br>
  -- Markup is how it is displayed (formatting)
  <br>
  -- HTML contains hyperlinks which are links to other content on the web.  Hyperlinks make the web 'weblike'
  <br>
  - The web was created in the early 90's anbd contains around 30 billion web pages.

  <b> <em> Structure Of The Web</em></b>
  <br>
  The web is a collcetion of HTMl documents stored on servers.  People interact with the 
  web/HTML documents using a browser on a computer.  Communication between the browsers,
  internet, and servers happnes with a protocol called HTTP:

  <b> <em> HTML Basics</em></b>
  <br>
  As stated previously, the web is a collection of HTML pages which can contain a wide
  variety of different content.  A few examples of content are:
  <br> - text
  <br> - images
  <br> - video
  <br>- documents
  <br>
  <br>
  HTML is constructed of various tags.  Some tags have opening and closing tags and
  other tags do not have a closing tag. Tags without a closing tag are known as void tags.
  <br>
  Tags can be inline or block tags.  An inline tag is just like it sounds.  It goes
  inline with the text.  Block tags have height and width.  There is an invisible rectangle
  around block elements.

  <b><em>Computers Are Stupid</em></b>
  <br>
  <b><em>And Programmers Don't Need To Remember Everything</em></b>
  <br>
  Computers only do exactly what the programmer instructs it to do.  Very simple mistakes 
  that a human could easily spot cause problems for computers.  The code needs
  to be perfect with all tags properly constructed for the page to work properly.
  <br>
  There is alot for the programmer to remember to get the code correct.  It is important 
  that the programmer understand concepts, but the details can be found with a quick web 
  search so they don't need to remember every detail.
